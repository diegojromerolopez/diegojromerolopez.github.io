Summary: Welcome to Diego J’s blog on Software Engineering Research.

For anyone not knowing me, I’m a software engineer working in a startup in south Spain.

In 2014 I ended my Software Engineering Research Masters Program and not satisfied with what I’ve learned, I’m going to continue my research in this field.

This blog is going to be my notebook in this amazing trip.

Please, note that this blogs only reflect my personal opinions and views, it does *not* reflect the views of my past, present or future employers.
