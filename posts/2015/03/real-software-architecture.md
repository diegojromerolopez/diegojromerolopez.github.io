Summary: Recommendation of software architecture videotalk by Simon Brown.

Simon Brown is an independent software consultant from Jersey (UK) and gave this talk
about Software Architecture in GOTO Amsterdam 2014.

[![Software Architecture vs. Code GOTO 2014 talk](http://img.youtube.com/vi/GAFZcYlO5S0/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAFZcYlO5S0)

This talk delights me in several ways. First, Simon show us several common problems that happens in
many software companies: diagrams of the software are not synchronized with code because.
That is, we design some type of software architecture but we don't follow our own path when
coding.

He thinks (me too) that software diagram current methodologies are difficult and
not *pleasant* (I would say) to use. We continue to theorize about perfect software
designs but when we make the code we simply don't take them in consideration.

This way, he shows a software architecture model that enfatizes the communication inside
the team and with stakeholders. Thus, the most important thing is that these diagrams
can be the *actual plan* of the code of the project and with his guidelines we can have no
discrepancies between software architecture and code organization and structure. 

Simon has published a very [interesting book](https://leanpub.com/software-architecture-for-developers/) I plan to read.
I'll update this post in the future when I read it.

Go, watch the video and think about this problem.
