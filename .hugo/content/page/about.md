I'm a Software Engineer at [Telef√≥nica](https://www.telefonica.com/en/home), working in Aura's cognitive team. I'm also the former head of tecnology at [Bufete de Marketing](http://www.bufetedemarketing.com/) (now [inteliens](https://www.inteliens.com/)), former developer at Drivies, and intelligenia. I'm passionate about learning new things and testing new technologies.

Apart from work, I like jogging, astronomy, history and reading books.
