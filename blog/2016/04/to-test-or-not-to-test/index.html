<p>Some years ago I did not use any tests. We were cowboys in CodeWest where only fearful and strong people survive.</p>
<p>Sometimes we tested some actions and assumed that everything else worked fine. But for the most part, code where developed almost like our sub-conscience dictated us what to type: we were guided by instinct.</p>
<p>Of course, users of my applications were not so amused by this when they found software faulted and had to wait to me to repair it.</p>
<h1 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h1>
<p>In my last post I wrote about refactoring. This process allows us to improve software quality iteratively. That is, we should be always be refactoring our code, treating it like an evolving species.</p>
<h1 id="tests">Tests</h1>
<p>Every basic functionality must be tested by a test. That is the only way of knowing that our refactoring doesn&rsquo;t break our working software.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of tests: unit tests or functional tests. While unit tests assure me that core parts of software work fine, functional tests assert that what see the user is correct.</p>
<p>Testing with both types is a time-consuming task, but it is worth testing critical parts of software with unit and functional tests to assure the important parts work right.</p>
<h1 id="but-what-about-changes-in-functionality">But what about changes in functionality?</h1>
<p>One of the reasons we did not develop tests was because we believed it slowed down the agile process.</p>
<p>If you do tests, your throughput is lower, product owner validates functionality in a slower pace and the project can be slowed down or even stalled<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>My personal approach is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product owner/Client wants some new feature.</li>
<li>Show the client a storyboard that contains that functionality.</li>
<li>Design succinctly the functionality.</li>
<li>Code functionality as a prototype (without tests).</li>
<li>Show the result to the client.</li>
<li>If the result is approved:</li>
<li>Test it to assure functionality remains during refactoring.</li>
<li>Refactor it applying the best software design possible.</li>
<li>If the result is rejected, throw it away.</li>
<li>I suggest you to take a look to Test Driven Development even you don&rsquo;t apply it as is (as in my case<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>).</li>
</ul>
<p>Key concept here is prototyping. Many times, our client doesn&rsquo;t know that he/she wants. It could be because its business is not 100% specified or maybe his/her ideas of what he/she wants are not as clear as they should be. This way we deliver a working prototype that helps as an artifact to confirm or reject our idea of what the client wants<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Tests help us to assure that some functionality always works the desired way.</p>
<p>Refactoring and tests are two faces of the same coin. We cannot do one without the other.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t test functionality that is not validated by the client.</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
<hr>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>Maybe software projects stalling is not a direct cause of a slow development but your client running out of money. Thus, client will be demotivated if no prototype is delivered early. In my experience, there can be no more than 1-2 weeks without deliveries (excluding first spike that defines project basis).&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>There is some Test Driven Development criticism (e.g.: stackoverflow thread that argues that by using this technique, developers only intent is passing the test and not making a good software design. I partially agrees with that sentiment and that&rsquo;s the reason I wrote this post.&#160;<a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
</li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>A mockup storyboard is a good way to extract requirements but, in my experience, sometimes is not enough: business and external changes can make it obsolete once the working prototype is delivered.&#160;<a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
