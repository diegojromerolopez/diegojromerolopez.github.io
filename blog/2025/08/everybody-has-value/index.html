<h1 id=everybody-has-value>Everybody has value</h1>
<p>In this post I tell a <em>war story</em> that happened during my time in a
medium-sized multi-national company where I had a leadership role.</p>
<h2 id=introduction>Introduction</h2>
<p>Working there I had a good developer in my team with some
physical disabilities (vision related). Others hand the idea that they were frustrated in their
day-to-day role, and indeed it looked like they were.</p>
<p>This developer felt not being used at their 100% capacity, and consequently,
they felt undervalued. Not because anybody in the company was saying or even
implying that, but they felt that way.</p>
<h2 id=dramatis-personae>Dramatis personae</h2>
<p>There are several people that were in this story, let me present them to you:</p>
<h3 id=axl-a-developer-with-disabilities>Axl: a developer with disabilities</h3>
<p>Older developer, very intelligent and resourceful. A lot of skills and (above all)
<em>experience</em>.</p>
<p>A person that was always ready to help you, and eager to collaborate with the team.</p>
<p>Their only problem? A <em>pesky</em> physical disability that made them have visual difficulties.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s call them <em>Axl</em> (because <em>they rock!</em>)</p>
<h3 id=me-the-head-of-technology>Me, the head of technology</h3>
<p>Me, an inexperienced leader, trying to juggle being an individual contributor (IC),
and the leadership role I had at the time.</p>
<p>Working non-stop on a product that would be lauded by the client, I was on the verge
of being burned out because of overworking.</p>
<p>I was worried by the Axl situation for a while but was not able to get enough free time
to plan a solution for it.</p>
<h2 id=the-problem>The problem</h2>
<p>Axl could not read the screen well, so they were struggling with a complex software configuration
workflow. They were doing a long process by hand and making some (understandable) mistakes.</p>
<h2 id=the-solution>The solution</h2>
<p>I have always disliked manual intervention, so I proposed automatizing this flow. This developer
helped us a lot in the design and testing phases, and the delivery was a success.</p>
<p>Of course the issue was that the developer had no tasks to do. So, we were wondering what they can do.</p>
<p>After meeting with the product manager and the scrum master we decided to buy a new monitor for them,
and give them a new role: QA Engineer.</p>
<p>I proposed them a path to become a QA Engineer, the cost? Just an evening investigating what are the skills,
the tools, and the responsibilities that they should take.</p>
<p>He thanked me, and by that time, I was already on the path of leaving the company.</p>
<h2 id=epilogue>Epilogue</h2>
<p>After a while I was invited to a Christmas party and I was greeted by Axl profusely.
He had taken my advice of becoming a QA Engineer and was glad about that (I remember I smiled),
and they had decided to use some other tools different than the ones that I had proposed
(I remember I smiled even more). I did not smile because they took other decisions, but because
taking other decisions was a clear sign that they had taken the QA Engineer path by heart.</p>
<p>Once it was the 3 a.m. I left the party with a smile in my face.</p>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The companies need to be flexible when dealing with disabilities.
Usually your employee just needs some adaptation, physically, or
with a new role. Do that and I can guarantee that they can thrive.!</p>
