<p>His code (Python) was concurrent code and each thread used several libraries (BeautifulSoup4<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was one of them) which they were not thread-safe. What does it mean? It means we cannot assure that atomicity is achieved in some operations executed by the threads, effectively sharing some data that must not be shared.</p>
<p>I ended up helping him to set a critical section in these not-thread-safe parts of his code but this situation kept me wondering why a library that parses XML is not thread-safe and what kind of common resources used of the system. I couldn’t spend more time investigating this issue but this kept me wondering if this “feature” is not a case of bad software design.</p>
<p>Take a look if everything you are using is thread-safe before you start partitioning your execution flow in threads.</p>

<p>Technically, BeautifulSoup4 is a wrapper, not a library. Developer can choose several parsers available (html5lib, lxml…) when using it in an application. Html5lib library is what we were using at the time. ↩&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
