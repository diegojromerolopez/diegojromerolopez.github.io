<p>Pursuit new things. Be challenged. Be surrounded by people that inspires you.</p>
<h1 id=job-searching-successfully>Job searching successfully</h1>
<p><em>This post is totally my personal opinion so if you don&rsquo;t agree
with it, don&rsquo;t worry, there are multiple types of
software engineers/developers and all of them are nedeed by the
society.</em></p>
<p>I have been looking for a job for a while, doing some interviews
checking on some job postings and have successfully landed a new
job. These are some advice for other job-seekers in our profession.</p>
<p>As I am based on Madrid, take this advice as what it is, if you apply
in other job culture society you can get some unexpected results.</p>
<h2 id=online-search>Online search</h2>
<p>Search for job positions in LinkedIn and Glassdoor. Submit your CV to
positions that you have more than 60% of the skills that are listed.
Usually recruiters are not technical personel, and list some technologies, and skills without any knowledge of the actual requirements for the job.</p>
<p>Thus, keep a network of recruiters as contacts. Be courteous
when they offer you positions that are not a match for your
profile. They can get your desire job or at least some interviews
to develop a thick skin.</p>
<p>Big companies have their own job portals. Submit your CV to them
and wait to be noticed (unless you know somebody inside).</p>
<p>Your CV will only pass the first filter a bunch of times
so, apply to many positions and do the interviews.</p>
<p>Note that I do not consider making a door-to-door job search,
leaving CV in the front-desk of companies.
Most of the recruiting happen via internet
or your ex-coworkers and other contacts.</p>
<h2 id=recruiting-companies>Recruiting companies</h2>
<p>Contact recruiters of recruiting companies. Not only because
they work by searching jobs for people like you but to know
what&rsquo;s your value, what you can improve to make your profile
more desirable, etc.</p>
<p>They are experts in what the market demands and getting that
knowledge is helpful when deciding how to improve yourself
as a software engineer.</p>
<h2 id=moocs-personal-projects-etc>MOOCs, personal projects, etc</h2>
<p>Spending your free time doing some <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course>MOOCs</a> can be a waste of time.
MOOCs are good to get some superficial knowledge about a topic
(programming language, framework, topic, etc.). However, it is
very difficult to convince somebody of your skills in that area
only by having completed a course.</p>
<p>That is why a personal project can help you justify your skills.
But, in my experience, a good personal project takes a long time
and if you are not ready to spend most of your free time doing it,
you&rsquo;ll soon start questioning yourself about the point of your effort.</p>
<p>A project will help you show your skills but, it is not common that
any recruiter or even technical personel to take a look to your code.
Only has happened twice. The first time was when doing interviews
for startups.</p>
<h2 id=networking>Networking</h2>
<p>It is easier to having someone vouch for you for a job than
to convince a company that you&rsquo;ll be a good worker there.
That&rsquo;s why &ldquo;networking&rdquo; is important.</p>
<p>Keeping a good relationship with ex-coworkers and ex-bosses
is good for your career (and good for your psyche). Do not
burn bridges, and try to be the most profesional worker
you can.</p>
<p>They could recommend you for jobs or you can use them as
past references, in case you are expected to include them
in your submission.</p>
<h2 id=interviews>Interviews</h2>
<p>Interviewing is a skill that can be developed, that&rsquo;s why
I said &ldquo;develop a thick skin&rdquo;. Most of the time you will not
pass to the next step of the interview process. Note I don&rsquo;t
say &ldquo;fail&rdquo;, because there are multiple reasons you are not
a good match:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a cheaper candidate.</li>
<li>There is a better/more experienced candidate.</li>
<li>The position was closed during the interview process.</li>
<li>You had a bad day and &ldquo;bombed&rdquo; the interview.</li>
<li>The questions were impossible to solve for you.</li>
<li>&mldr; Any other reason you can imagine.</li>
</ul>
<p>You have to be prepared to receive the bad news
and learn form the experience. Usually you won&rsquo;t receive
any feedback (because of legal liability).</p>
<p>Many interview process have a step where you&rsquo;re asked
to do a &ldquo;small project&rdquo;. In my experience, you&rsquo;ll have
to spend more time in this project than they claim, and
it is only used for eliminating fake CVs.</p>
<p>In my last job search, I rejected some interview process
because they wanted me to develop trivial or non-interesting
projects. If I&rsquo;m going to spend my weekend doing a project
to show to you that I&rsquo;m good doing what I do. I expect this
project to be challenging, something that makes me learn about
a topic, and even show in my portfolio (github/gitlab).</p>
<p>Between interviews, study algorithmic problems with <a href=http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/>CTCI</a>,
<a href=https://leetcode.com/>leetcode</a> or whatever source of problems that make your head spin.</p>
<h2 id=be-challenged>Be challenged</h2>
<p>I enjoy being challenged in my job, and can get bored if I&rsquo;m doing the
same again and again. My opinion about how hard have to be your job
is that you should be learning something each week. It can be a new tool,
algorithm, feature of programming language, etc. As soon as the months
pass and you are not learning anything, you know it&rsquo;s time to go.</p>
<p>Some say that 2 years is the minimum period you should be in a company
before deciding to change jobs. My take is that with 1.5 years is more
than enough, but you should set a limit of time to start searching for
a new job. Take in account that (in my experience), finding a good job
can take at least 6 month, so don&rsquo;t wait until you feel burnout to
start looking.</p>
<h2 id=important-do-not-stress-yourself>IMPORTANT: Do not stress yourself</h2>
<p>Do not stress yourself with the idea of looking for a job. If you
have a job that is boring but pays reasonable well, and feel
depressed, do not start looking for a new job.
Work on your mental health (having professional help can be a good idea)
and when you feel ready, start &ldquo;the grind&rdquo; again.</p>
<h2 id=final-advice>Final advice</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not leave your job before having another one.</li>
<li>Job search is a good push for profesional improvement.</li>
<li>Staying in a dead-end job can be harmful for your metal health and career.</li>
<li>Be profesional during the interview process and try to learn something in each of them.</li>
