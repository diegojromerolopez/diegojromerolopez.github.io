Programming? Algorithms? Knowing many language or the internals of some languages? No.
The best skill for a software engineer is knowing how to write well. There are some studies that establish a relationship between language skills and programming skills. It seems having strong language skills is better than being good at math when talking about developing software.
I can imagine that that&amp;rsquo;s because communication is a foundation of software engineering.</description></item><item><title>Conventions</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/2020-01-01-conventions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Nobody, but you&amp;rsquo;ll get my point along this post.
Conventions ## Write the code to make it obvious
Every software engineer develops an unique style of coding through their career. Usually they starts coding tangled code that is extremly difficult to understand to anybody but theyself. Later you get to the point where you are unable to understand your own code, and began to wonder how is that possible.</description></item><item><title>Job searching successfully</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/2019-08-01-job-searching-successfully/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Job searching successfully This post is totally my personal opinion so if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree with it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are multiple types of software engineers/developers and all of them are nedeed by the society.
I have been looking for a job for a while, doing some interviews checking on some job postings and have successfully landed a new job.</description></item></channel></rss>
