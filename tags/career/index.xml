This is a long post, I do not recommend reading it in one sitting.
Faulty engineering ladders Most companies I worked for had some kind of Engineering ladder. It looks nice and promising to know that you can be promoted. However, in my experience there is no clear path for promotion.</description></item><item><title>Leadership with passive subjects</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2024/12/leadership-with-passive-subjects/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

However, what about the opposite? What can happen when a developer is not interested in improve their skills and is dragging down the team?
Along this post we will delve on the subject of what to do when you have to lead over different types of developers.</description></item><item><title>What is the most useful skill for software engineers?</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2020/02/what-is-the-most-useful-skill-for-software-engineers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Programming? Algorithms? Knowing many language or the internals of some languages? No.
The best skill for a software engineer is knowing how to write well. There are some studies that establish a relationship between language skills and programming skills. It seems having strong language skills is better than being good at math when talking about developing software.
I can imagine that that&amp;rsquo;s because communication is a foundation of software engineering.</description></item><item><title>Conventions</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2020/01/conventions/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Nobody, but you&amp;rsquo;ll get my point along this post.
Conventions Having the same language is better than having different dialects or languages when speaking of the same thing.
## Write the code to make it obvious
Every software engineer develops an unique style of coding through their career. Usually they starts coding tangled code that is extremely difficult to understand to anybody but theyself.

Be surrounded by people that inspires you.
Job searching successfully This post is totally my personal opinion so if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree with it, don&amp;rsquo;t worry, there are multiple types of software engineers/developers and all of them are nedeed by the society.
I have been looking for a job for a while, doing some interviews checking on some job postings and have successfully landed a new job.</description></item></channel></rss>
