Introduction I created the Djanban project 9 years ago. At that time I was studying a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Software Project Management by the Technical University of Madrid.
The project Djanban was born as an extension of Trello.</description></item><item><title>Using LLMs to create a python library</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/12/using-llms-to-create-a-python-library/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Introduction I think that static analysis in Python is a great opportunity to catch a lot of issues before running the program.
I do not even remember when, but I saw a thread in the Python official forum where a user was suggesting this @pure decorator idea to the Steering Council of Python.</description></item><item><title>Use LLMs to handle tedious tasks</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/11/use-llms-to-handle-tedious-tasks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

We know how to do it but usually delay them because they are boring, not challenging and painfully long. The LLMs (Large Language Models) promise faster and better software development. Could we use a LLM to do them? Could we leverage the LLMs to free them from these chores?</description></item><item><title>The case for LLMs: faster development</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/06/the-case-for-llms-faster-development/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

From the first AI services that could generate images, to the code generation tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, etc.
I wrote in other post that LLMs are not going to replace software engineers, but they are going to empower them in a lot of cases.
This post is a war story of mine, where I used a LLM service to create a new command for a CLI command tool written in a compiled language that I do not master.</description></item><item><title>Can LLMs replace engineers?</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/05/can-llms-replace-engineers/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

This post provides my opinion about how a LLMs cannot replace a senior software engineer, even if the CEOs and other executives believe that it is possible.
Introduction I have been using Artificial Intelligence (in the form of LLMs) for several years already. My experience working with LLMs is limited to working with ChatGPT, Cursor and GitHub Copilot as of May 2025 (when this post was written).</description></item></channel></rss>
