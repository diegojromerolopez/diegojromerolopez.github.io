Sometimes they are sent to external services like or written in a log by accident. Would not be useful to have a tool to limit the access to secrets? Enter EyesOnly.
EyesOnly: a package to limit access to secrets Dealing last years with containerazing applications has left me thinking in how we are passing some secrets as environment variables to the container. This is standard practice by the Cloud Native practitioners.</description></item><item><title>Asking and receiving feedback on your software project</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2021/07/asking-and-receiving-feedback-on-your-software-project/</link><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Why immutability? Nowadays, most processors have some kind of parallelism or concurrency embedded in themselves. Single-flow-execution software is limited by the lowest speed unit in the system.
