Thus, I&amp;rsquo;m posting in this blog whatever thoughts appear in my mind about Software Developing.
I&amp;rsquo;m several chapters in Code Complete 2nd Ed. of Steve McConnel and I&amp;rsquo;m amazed by the knowledge that it contains. As time goes by I will update this blog with more information about my findings.
Specially I&amp;rsquo;ve been struck by one basic principle: Software construction is the only activity that is warrantied to be made in a software development project.</description></item><item><title>Peopleware</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2015/08/peopleware/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Let me put some light in this matter.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working for 8 years in a startup and none of my formal education in the University prepared me for what I was going to experiment. Software Engineering is a social discipline (we work in teams) but in my Computer Engineering degree1 there are no management or organization courses.</description></item><item><title>Back to basics, the mythical man-month</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2014/11/back-to-basics-the-mythical-man-month/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Without any existing knowledge and only his own experience in the &amp;ldquo;tar pit&amp;rdquo; (as himself call this software development world), he distilled some universal truths of the Software Engineering world. So, the Mythical Man-Month is a summary of his ideas.
This book is a night stand book, that is, you cannot hope to end it in a few days. You have to read slowly, thinking as a 60s software developer, with their limited tools and machines to fully understand this book.</description></item></channel></rss>
