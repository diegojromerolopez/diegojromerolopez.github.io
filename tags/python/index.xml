      <description>Last friday, one of my mates had a strange error in his code: incoherent an irrepetible results arise en each execution.
His code (Python) was concurrent code and each thread used several libraries (BeautifulSoup41 was one of them) which they were not thread-safe. What does it mean? It means we cannot assure that atomicity is achieved in some operations executed by the threads, effectively sharing some data that must not be shared.</description>
