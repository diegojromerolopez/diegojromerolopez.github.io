Why have I been silent all this time? I could say that life matters have made me pretty busy (and that is true), but apart from that, what things have I been working on?
Things I worked with Deno Deno, the next-generation JavaScript runtime created by Ryan Dahl, the Node.js creator.
It think it is a great idea but it has some rough edges, let&amp;rsquo;s hope that with the coming of Deno 2 and the full support for commonJS modules and other new features it can achieve the status it deserves.</description></item></channel></rss>
