The infrastructure became more programmable, flexible, scalable, and abstracted. But that did not mean that the systems became simpler.
Architecting for the cloud The cloud companies were born as a way to reduce complexity for the engineering teams. However, the complexity was not removed, but moved from the engineering teams to the cloud systems.
But creating complex architectures in the cloud has a clear counterpart: how can we ensure they work properly?</description></item><item><title>Write tests. Not too many.

This is some advice that appear first at Twitter by Guillermo Rauch. Years have passed since I read it and now I am at a position to reflect on them and how I was following this advice even when I did not know that explicitly.
Introduction Some years ago I was developing an internal web application for a non-techie team. I was working with React and reading a lot of tutorials, guides, and documentation (in case you are wondering I was mostly focused on backend those days).</description></item><item><title>The testing pyramid</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/06/the-testing-pyramid/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

We are going to delve into what are the different types of tests that you should do in your software to have some assurance about your code.
Introduction I wrote some time ago a post about the difference between unit and integration testing, and while re-reading it today I was not convinced that it was clear enough.
Integration tests is a concept that has been used many times in different environments and at different levels, so I want to give a proper definition of each one of the test types at project and system level.</description></item><item><title>How to write a good unit test</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/04/how-to-write-a-good-unit-test/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

There are some examples in Python with unittest.
Introduction In my last post I wrote about software quality not being taken seriously sometimes.
Tests are a good part of the software quality so I wanted to write a bit about the testing effort we should be doing in our code.</description></item><item><title>Actual integration tests</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2022/11/actual-integration-tests/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

How is that possible? Is that because of bad tests or we have a greater hidden issue?
Protect your vital functionality with integration tests Integration tests are the best way make sure that a functionality does not degradate when adding new features.
What are integration tests Integration tests are tests that check a full feature of the project.</description></item><item><title>To test or not to test</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2016/04/to-test-or-not-to-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

We were cowboys in CodeWest where only fearful and strong people survive.
Sometimes we tested some actions and assumed that everything else worked fine. But for the most part, code where developed almost like our sub-conscience dictated us what to type: we were guided by instinct.
Of course, users of my applications were not so amused by this when they found software faulted and had to wait to me to repair it.</description></item></channel></rss>
