Having dealt with a full rewrite of a software application recently, it left me wondering if it was needed at all, if there was any way to salvage the project or some parts of the project. Could we have avoided the rewrite?
Introduction I have encountered the necessity of rewriting full software projects several times in my career but in my last years I have had to do it twice.</description></item><item><title>Using LLMs to create a python library</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/12/using-llms-to-create-a-python-library/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Introduction I think that static analysis in Python is a great opportunity to catch a lot of issues before running the program.
I do not even remember when, but I saw a thread in the Python official forum where a user was suggesting this @pure decorator idea to the Steering Council of Python.</description></item><item><title>Use LLMs to handle tedious tasks</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/11/use-llms-to-handle-tedious-tasks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

We know how to do it but usually delay them because they are boring, not challenging and painfully long. The LLMs (Large Language Models) promise faster and better software development. Could we use a LLM to do them? Could we leverage the LLMs to free them from these chores?</description></item><item><title>Release always, even partial features</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/11/release-always-even-partial-features/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Introduction In this post I will tell an early in my career story when I first learned that the release of anything is always better than release nothing.
Death march Agility Conclusion I have described a situation where a feature could not be released but instead of blocking the full feature, I decided to release a partial version of the feature.</description></item><item><title>Everybody has value</title><link>https://diegojromerolopez.github.io/blog/2025/08/everybody-has-value/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>diegojromerolopez@gmail.com (Diego J.

Introduction Working there I had a good developer in my team with some physical disabilities (vision related). Others hand the idea that they were frustrated in their day-to-day role, and indeed it looked like they were.

Introduction Most of the project management methodologies have a focus on improving the satisfaction of the clients and users. Most of the time by removing friction between them and the development process, or by reducing waste.
CV Driven Development has as one of the non-functional requirements learning something new.</description></item></channel></rss>
