      What is the most useful skill for software engineers? Programming? Algorithms? Knowing many language or the internals of some languages? No.
The best skill for a software engineer is knowing how to write well. There are some studies that establish a relationship between language skills and programming skills. It seems having strong language skills is better than being good at math when talking about developing software.
I can imagine that that&rsquo;s because communication is a foundation of software engineering.

Conventions ## Write the code to make it obvious
Every software engineer develops an unique style of coding through their career. Usually they starts coding tangled code that is extremly difficult to understand to anybody but theyself. Later you get to the point where you are unable to understand your own code, and began to wonder how is that possible.

Sometimes we tested some actions and assumed that everything else worked fine. But for the most part, code where developed almost like our sub-conscience dictated us what to type: we were guided by instinct.
Of course, users of my applications were not so amused by this when they found software faulted and had to wait to me to repair it.

Firstly, Software Engineering has an immaterial final product. It is not a bridge, a road, or a mine for example. Thus, software engineers works with ideas more than anything else.
Thus, traditional engineers are limited by Physics laws while software engineers are only limited by the computational model they use and by the power of the machines their software run.

      Donald E. Knuth coined the term Literate programming in this paper he wrote almost 40 years ago.
Knuth wrote a tool called WEB as a demonstration of what Literate Programming should be. This tool would understand Pascal and TeX code, using Pascal code to create a binary executable and using TeX code to compile its documentation file. Pascal code would be a bit different because of the use of predefined macros and it would be interleaved by TeX code describing what actions execute.

      &ldquo;Tar pit&rdquo; is an idiom used since 1970s based on the similarity between software complexity and tar pits trapping engineers and animals (resp.).
Out of the tar pit is a paper that analyzes the causes of this complexity and classifies it in several categories. The authors also analyzes the approaches that each type of programming technique uses to sove this complexity problem.
But the most important contribution the authors do is giving a solution in the form of a new paradigm of computer programming.

      Several days ago, I watched this videotalk of Mary Shaw that tried to give an answer to the question is Software Engineering an Engineering discipline yet?
Dr. Shaw makes a parallelism with Civil Engineering that started as a empirical discipline and, thanks to strong scientific foundations, evolved to what we could call full engineering.
Software Engineering is not there yet. It needs more work and professionalization. Many of the so-called Software Engineers have no software engineering knowledge and/or skills and therefore software disasters happens.

His code (Python) was concurrent code and each thread used several libraries (BeautifulSoup41 was one of them) which they were not thread-safe. What does it mean? It means we cannot assure that atomicity is achieved in some operations executed by the threads, effectively sharing some data that must not be shared.

      The Players It&rsquo;s not a secret that software engineers prefer a clean and completed specification than metting with clients.
We tend to think that meetings are a waste of time and many of our colleagues are not very fond of what is called soft skills.
On the other side, we have some clients that have no idea about software and want the changes in their platform now.
What is all of that?

      Simon Brown is an independent software consultant from Jersey (UK) and gave this talk about Software Architecture in GOTO Amsterdam 2014.
This talk delights me in several ways. First, Simon show us several common problems that happens in many software companies: diagrams of the software are not synchronized with code because. That is, we design some type of software architecture but we don&rsquo;t follow our own path when coding.
He thinks (me too) that software diagram current methodologies are difficult and not pleasant (I would say) to use.

      Frederick P. Brooks is what I&rsquo;d call a true pioneer.
Without any existing knowledge and only his own experience in the &ldquo;tar pit&rdquo; (as himself call this software development world), he distilled some universal truths of the Software Engineering world. So, the Mythical Man-Month is a summary of his ideas.
This book is a night stand book, that is, you cannot hope to end it in a few days. You have to read slowly, thinking as a 60s software developer, with their limited tools and machines to fully understand this book.
