Without any existing knowledge and only his own experience in the &amp;ldquo;tar pit&amp;rdquo; (as himself call this software development world), he distilled some universal truths of the Software Engineering world. So, the Mythical Man-Month is a summary of his ideas.
This book is a night stand book, that is, you cannot hope to end it in a few days. You have to read slowly, thinking as a 60s software developer, with their limited tools and machines to fully understand this book.</description></item></channel></rss>
