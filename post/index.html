    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Introduction A month ago I asked the HN Community for some feedback about my project: Gelidum.
The experience was very positive and I have learned that asking for feedback in a software project is crucial.
Why feedback is important? We know that feedback is important because it gives us a different point of view about a matter or in my case, a project.
But, feedback is not limited to giving different points of view.

      Introduction In this post I will explain the rationale about working with immutable objects and will present a personal project I&rsquo;ve been working on the last few days: Gelidum.
La nevada by Francisco de Goya
Why immutability? Nowadays, most processors have some kind of parallelism or concurrency embeded in themselves. Single-flow-execution software is limited by the lowest speed unit in the system. There are some solutions that try to hide the wait for these slow sub-systems by computing in other execution-flows (threads or processes).

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Introduction There is a mooc in the University of Helsinki about the ethics of artificial intelligenice. I just started it and it&rsquo;s great.
The triumph of technicism Us engineers tend to think that there is no problem (technical or else) that cannot be resolved by technological means. That&rsquo;s called technicism.
Usually that&rsquo;s right for small-scale problems or systems, but in the case of artificial intelligence, or being more precise machine learning that&rsquo;s not true.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      What is the most useful skill for software engineers? Programming? Algorithms? Knowing many language or the internals of some languages? No.
The best skill for a software engineer is knowing how to write well. There are some studies that establish a relationship between language skills and programming skills. It seems having strong language skills is better than being good at math when talking about developing software.
I can imagine that that&rsquo;s because communication is a foundation of software engineering.

Nobody, but you&rsquo;ll get my point along this post.
Conventions ## Write the code to make it obvious
Every software engineer develops an unique style of coding through their career. Usually they starts coding tangled code that is extremly difficult to understand to anybody but theyself. Later you get to the point where you are unable to understand your own code, and began to wonder how is that possible.

      Introduction Some years ago I did not use any tests. We were cowboys in CodeWest where only fearful and strong people survive.
Sometimes we tested some actions and assumed that everything else worked fine. But for the most part, code where developed almost like our sub-conscience dictated us what to type: we were guided by instinct.
Of course, users of my applications were not so amused by this when they found software faulted and had to wait to me to repair it.

Refactoring Refactoring is the process of changing code structure for the better while keeping the same functionality. It should be a continuos activity made during software development, with the aim of easing maintainability of software.
