I am a Staff Software Engineer at [Rebrandly](https://www.rebrandly.com/).
My main focus is  driving technical stability and modernization in complex, high-scale systems.
I am focused on reducing technical risk, improving maintainability, and enabling sustainable delivery.

Previously, I was Senior Software Engineer at [Flywire](https://www.flywire.com/es), working in the Engineering Productivity team. 
Before that, I spent several years working at [Telefónica](https://www.telefonica.com/en/home), in Aura's cognitive team.
I am also the former head of technology at [Bufete de Marketing](http://www.bufetedemarketing.com/) 
(now [inteliens](https://www.inteliens.com/)), former developer at [Drivies](https://www.linkedin.com/company/drivies/), 
and intelligenia (now part of Nazaríes IT).

I am passionate about learning, creating complex systems, and making software simpler, safer, and more sustainable to work with.

Apart from work, I like jogging, history and reading books.

I write this blog as a technical diary, with the aim of helping my future-me.
I do not intend to create a perfect resource, nor an information resource for
others. The aim is to create an useful resource for me. It is useful for you,
good!
