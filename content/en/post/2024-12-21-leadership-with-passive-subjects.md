# Leadership with passive subjects
Most leadership advice (that I have read) assumes all the team members are motivated
and want to improve themselves. However, what about the opposite? What can happen
when a developer is not interested in improve their skills and is dragging down the team?


## Conclusion
There are people that don't want to improve and need to be left alone. We cannot convince them,
nor push them in any way.
