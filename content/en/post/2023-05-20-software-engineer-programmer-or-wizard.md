# Software engineering, programmer or wizard

## Introduction
I have been named many things (with respect to my
profession) some of them were not actually correct.
Should I correct people? Should I be worried about
this?

## Naming
They say that naming something creates it.
Does being called a Software Engineer increases
our work level? Does it give more respect profession-wise?

As our discipline evolves, we have had many names
from programmers, to software developers, software
engineers, or even wizards!

We can agree that naming something, creates it,
it is important that the name of a things reflect
the thing itself.
