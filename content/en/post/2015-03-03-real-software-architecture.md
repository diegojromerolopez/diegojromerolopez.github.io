Simon Brown is an independent software consultant from Jersey (UK) and gave this talk about Software Architecture in GOTO Amsterdam 2014.

This talk delights me in several ways. First, Simon show us several common problems that happens in many software companies: diagrams of the software are not synchronized with code because. That is, we design some type of software architecture but we don't follow our own path when coding.

He thinks (me too) that software diagram current methodologies are difficult and not pleasant (I would say) to use. We continue to theorize about perfect software designs but when we make the code we simply don't take them in consideration.

This way, he shows a software architecture model that emphasizes the communication inside the team and with stakeholders. Thus, the most important thing is that these diagrams can be the actual plan of the code of the project and with his guidelines we can have no discrepancies between software architecture and code organization and structure.

Simon has published a very interesting book I plan to read. I'll update this post in the future when I read it.

Go, watch the video and think about this problem.
