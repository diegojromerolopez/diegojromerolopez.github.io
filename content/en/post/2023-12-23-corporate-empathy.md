# Corporate empathy
In this times of diversity based on gender, ethnical background,
culture, etc. Is that enough? Do we have to be careful when
talking with other coworker if they do not belong to any
of the main categories? Can we say what we would like and in the way we
would like? No, we need to treat them *empthically*.


## Communication in the workplace
When in every day job, we need to communicate with our coworkers.
We do not work in a bubble, we need something from them, they
need something from us, we need to warn them or send them a piece
or information they need. These are possible reasons we need to
do what humans do best: communicate.

## Software is a social profession
While the stereotype is that software developers are in a basement
and are reluctant or even unable to socialize with other person,
the reality is totally different: pair-programming, code reviews,
documentation reviews, incidents, issues, etc.
All of these activites require that at least two persons work together
to achieve a successful outcome.

## Forms are important
The same way we use "please" when we need something, and "thank you" when
somebody makes us a favor, we need to keep a formal level of language. There
are ton of stories about startups, small companies or whatever other environments
where they work with a fraternity-like environment
(*I should say fraternity 80s movie style*). Of course, when people behave
that way, some are going to get hurt.

Workplace is no place for things that could be normal with friends and viceversa.

## Empathy
Empathy is the quality of thinking about others when acting. Thinking in the effects
of what we are going to do before doing it.

Having empathy with a coworker because it is a person is a must.

## Empathy in the workplace
When it is required? Always. In our case, as software developers, most communication
happens in written form, but even so, we need to follow a good behaviour when
interacting with others. If we allow toxicity, resentment or tribalism to grow
in an organization, we are not going to achieve anything, anytime.

Some advice I think could be useful for engineers:

### Be aware of cultural differences
More than 10 years ago, I travelled to London, and while I was in a train station.
I went to a sandwich shop and ordered a sandwich there. How did I do it? With all
my good intentions I said: *Good afternoon, I want a sandwich*. My brother, that
was living there for a while was *horrified* by my manners. The thing is that
Spanish is a more direct language, because of its low information rate. Of course,
that is not the case of English, so I sounded like a troglodyte.

A good English as a Second Language speaker would have not falled for this,
but my poor English skills, fruit of watching uncountable TV sitcoms and series
were not on par with a native speaker.

### Be courteous
Related to the point above, as most of us use English as a second language,
we need to be actively enforcing a different way of communicating. What I mean
by this is that we speak and write not just by translating in our heads from
our native language to English, but we try to adapt our communication to the
culture of the recipient. As it is impossible if we are communicating with
people with different cultures, the best way to minimize issues is
to present oursleves as *extemely* courteous individuals.

I know sometimes this manner of speak could be seen as *old-fashioned* or
outdated, but I would say it is a good way to not seen as rude or impolite:
**it is better to be courteous and polite in excess, than the opposite**.

### Difusse stressful situations
*Stress is a mind-killer*. It converts us from empathic animals to violent deranged
creatures. Avoiding stress or in the case that is impossible difusse or even reduce
it is a must if we want to continue working on our best behaviour.

**Cortisol, the stress hormone, is known to reduce the empathy in animals**
([source](https://neurosciencenews.com/cortisol-altrusim-empathy-20262/)).

### Offer help to others
What a better way to understand other people than to *get in their shoes*?
Helping others is a good way to improve relationships, understand the issues
others are facing, learn new things, and of course, develop better software.

Helping junior members of your team is an investment, as it is going to be
valuable in the future when they are more autonomous.

Helping senior members of your team is a way to learn new skills, technologies,
business rules, etc. It is a way of improving yourself in the context of the
company.

**If you are working alone, something is wrong**.

### Do not blame
I tend to check git story when reviewing some old feature. It helps me
think like the developer thought when developing that. When the code
is not particularly good, a temptation is always present to blame the
original author, but what has experience showed me? That many times,
I am the culprit!

Bad code, bugs, mistakes, etc. are not more than a product of our
fallibility as humans. All issues are opportunities for improvement,
bad code could be refactored, a bug needs to be fixed and have a test
with the correct behaviour...

What are you going to gain if you blame somebody? Do you know how they were
working on the feature? Do you know if they were stressed or what resources
do they have it? No, **you are judging an issue with a huge bias**. That is
not productive, keep an open mind, and if you see something that could be
improved, **could not you help them to improve it?**

### Praise in public, criticize in private
Some time ago, I saw a pull request review were the reviewer doubted of the skills
of the creator of that code **publicly**. That started a discussion and accusations
between the reviewer and the author of the code in several of our chat channels.
I was astounded about this situation. What are you going to win apart from making
the other angry?

It is better to praise in public (everybody likes that), and if there are something
that could be improved, have a direct chat with them.

### Criticize with good intent
Keep in mind that you need to formulate your criticism in a way that helps to the
recipient. Even better, do not think of that message as criticsm, but as something
that needs to help them to improve.

I still remember a 360-feedback round where the question was
*What do you think they need to improve?*

### When in doubt, assume good intentions
I tend to think about the things too much. From time to time, I receive a
chat message that makes me irk. Most of the time, I am in the wrong, and
as I work in international environments, it is a bad-translated idiom, or
something that sounds better in their native language, etc.

Of course, there is also the possibility of having a bad day, being stressed,
or having a *mental meltdown* that makes us think bad about a received
communication.

Do not do that. **Always assume the person** is not aggressive, but
**is a poor communicator**. Communication issues are abundant,
and it is better if we stop miscommunication and try to have an
open mind about it.

## Foster an empathy culture in your organization
In one of my positions at a software developer at the main telecomunications
commpany in Spain, Telefonica, I enjoyed this kind of *empathy culture*
like in no other place I have worked for.

Management there was always encouraging collaboration
between coworkers, all issues were solved fast and effectively by managers,
there was no drama, only the issues of the proper issues of the trade,
software development.

## Conclusion
Do you think you could improve the environment in your organization?
Is enough with online courses? Should an empathic communication be encouraged
in your organization?
