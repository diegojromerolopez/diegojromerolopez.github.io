#Â The different types of personality
There are several frames that try to define the different types of personality
(without any kind of particular order):

- [Surrounded by idiots](https://www.surroundedbyidiots.com/en/books/surrounded-by-idiots/)
- [C-me colour profiling](https://www.colour-profiling.com/)
- [Disc profiles](https://www.discprofiles.com/disc-styles/)
- [The four tendencies](https://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-four-tendencies/)

## What are those?
Several psychology researchers have determined that people can be grouped based on
4 personality profiles.

Mainly they define the following dimensions:

- Analytical
- Dominant
- Social/Leader
- Cooperative

## How do they affect your communication?
Depending on what dimension reflects more on you, you will need to improve other areas
were you are not so skilled. For example if you are not a *social animal*, maybe you
need to be more careful or have more tact when talking with team mates.

The diversity of the ways of expressing one's idea is abysmal, so what you think you are
saying is different than what you are actually saying, and different to what the other
interlocutor understands.

So when something falls in the real of interpretation, you need to make sure there is
only a meaning of what you are saying.

## What can I do to solve this issue?
Well, you could do a test (like the C-me test) and identify your strengths and debilities.

### Know your interlocutor
I said above that you need to make sure that the interlocutor understands you. The only
way to do it is by knowing them.

How?

### Be more empathic
When the interlocutor does not understand the thing you meant, you need to put yourself
in their position and communicate in a way they can understand you.

i.e. if you know the background of your interlocutor, talk in a way that they
can relate to it.

For example, if you know that the interlocutor had a particular experience, you can use that
in your favour (as long as the experience relates with the issue at hand).

### Be more explicit
In case you do not know the background of your interlocutor you would need to make examples
and use tools to communicate better.

### Aks for help
Maybe others can be of assistance in the conversation.

For example, if you are an *analytical* person and you are struggling to make you understand
to a *dominant* person, you should use the help of a *collaborator*.

## Conclusion
Embrace diversity, we humans think differently, and that is a good thing.
