# New Year's resolutions
This new year has just started (well 27 days ago), but
I have been thinking about what I would like to learn
and change during this 2024. Here are my personal thoughts
on the matter. I hope they could inspire you to do a
similar list.

## What I would like to learn

### Tech

### Domain Driven Design
Code bases I have worked on in my career tend to have some
tech debt, and the code structure is very different depending
on the developer that created the code. Do not know if true,
but the promise of a common language not only between the
product team and developers, but even among themselves, seems
seductive.

## Terraform
A language for software infrastructure always seem interesting.
Many organizations use it and that is also useful for my career.

## Golang
The google language that which is used in Docker and Kubernetes.
I started learning it in 2020 but have not worked significatly
with it in the past years. I would like to do a library for it,
let's see if I find the time to do it.

## Others

### Communication
Being able to have difficult conversations or how to do
announcements are things that I have already been doing for a
while, but I need to keep working on that.

### English
While I consider myself to have a proficient skill in English,
to keep up-to-date it is a continous battle: idioms and
pronunciation of uncommon words are areas I would like to improve.

# Conclusion
What are your New Year's resolutions? Do you plan to learn
a new programming language?
