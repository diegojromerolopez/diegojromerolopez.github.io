You never stop learning. Embrace learning new things.

# 2018 recap

## Machine learning

Learning about Machine Learning had been a not-acomplished steping stone in my career.
Joinig some Kaggle competitions and read other's people code makes improves your habilities.

Wonderful Sci-kit and pandas libraries make use of ML algorithms easy and neat.


## Ruby

Having not used [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org)
(albeit many years ago in my MRes. programme I programmed some basic scripts),
it was funny to learn its peculiarities and of course, its *dark corners*.


## Ruby on Rails

Having worked many years with Django, the switch to Ruby on Rails was easy but not painless.
Ruby on Rails is a more mature framework but Django is a more complete one. Discovering how
RoR solves some common problems offers me a different way of thinking and a refreshing of
that kind of knowledge.


## Ruby code quality tools

[Rubocop](https://github.com/rubocop-hq/rubocop), [Reek](https://github.com/troessner/reek), [Flay](https://github.com/seattlerb/flay), etc. and the master of all, [Overcommit](https://github.com/brigade/overcommit) are great tools. I have not found similar tools in Python (only Pylint seems to do some of the work these Ruby tools do).


## TDD

Almost nobody does TDD in a pure form. Me neither. But the closest I have reached to include TDD in my
workflow has been working with Ruby on Rails this year.


## PostgresSQL

I know SQL but having a real RDBMS to work with is the best.
MySQL limitations where more than a pain in the neck.

PostgresSQL offers many interesting features other RDBMS lack off:
- JSONB fields (with GIN indices).
- Transactional DDL.
- WITH keyword.
- Internal optimizations (e.g. subqueries are optimized to joins when it is possible).


## CI/CD

Implement for real continous integration and countinous deployment in a Ruby on Rails project has been a pleasure.

Having enough test coverage to be relaxed on the deployments ease my mind and eliminate stress.

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) has been showed as acgreat platform for definind CI/CD pipelines, cheap
and you can install in your own server too.


## Mathematics

Need to refresh my knowledge about Maths for being ready to understand concepts like Gradient Descent and eigenvectors.

Took the first two courses of the [Mathematics for Machine learning specialization in Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning).


## Deep Learning

In October of this year, I decided to take the step and enrol in a PhD programme.
I have been learning Deep Learning (using Jupyter notebooks and Keras) since then by following these sources:

* [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al.
* [Stanford CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/).
* [Deep Learning with Python](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python) by Fran√ßois Chollet.

Thus, using a remote server with GPUs has been a new experience for me.


# "Next year resolutions"

These are some next year resolutions that I'll try to acomplish:

* Learn more about DevOps:
  * AWS
  * Heroku
* Continue learning about Deep Learning.
* Learn about probability foundations for Machine Learning.
* Maybe learn some Spark (and hence Scala).
* Improve my English a bit.


# Conclusion

Never stop learning. For your career. For yourself.
