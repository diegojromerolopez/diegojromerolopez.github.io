I am a Staff Software Engineer at Rebrandly. My main focus is driving technical stability and modernization in complex, high-scale systems. I am focused on reducing technical risk, improving maintainability, and enabling sustainable delivery.
Previously, I was Senior Software Engineer at Flywire, working in the Engineering Productivity team. Before that, I spent several years working at Telefónica, in Aura&amp;rsquo;s cognitive team. I am also the former head of technology at Bufete de Marketing (now inteliens), former developer at Drivies, and intelligenia (now part of Nazaríes IT).</description></item></channel></rss>
